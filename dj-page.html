  <h1>DJ Reims</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
  <p>DJ Reims was born and bred in the west suburbs of Chicago. His music background comes from being an avid gamer at a young age and has loved the compositions of video games since then. His idea of wearing a mask came from wanting to have a memorable image/presence, while obtaining a personal life as well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Artists that have influenced me:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Dubstep:</strong> Excision, Zomboy, JPhelpz, Barely Alive, and Virtual Riot</li>
  <li><strong>Electro House:</strong> Wolfgang Gartner, Mord Fustang, and Deadmau5</li>
  <li><strong>House:</strong> Disclosure, Phlegmatic Dogs, Daft Punk, and Tchami</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
  <p>I am a local DJ available for bookings in Chicago and the surrounding area/states. I mainly mix tracks produced by other various artists/producers and I also produce my own music and continue to grow both as a DJ and as a musician.</p>
