  <p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
  <p>DJ Reims was born and bred in the west suburbs of Chicago. His music background comes from being an avid gamer at a young age and has loved the compositions of video games since then. His idea of wearing a mask came from wanting to have a memorable image/presence, while obtaining a personal life as well.</p>
